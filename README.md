# BruteForce
Learning and understanding the fundaments of a brute for attack. How they can be optimized and how to prevent them.
This current example searches for through exact matches. It will serach though upper and lowercase characters as well as numbers and some symbols.
I have left the previous versions commented out in order to see what I originally came up with to match individual characters to what it does now.
The algorithm is extremly slow after 5-6 character, it may be possible to impliment some multithreading functionality but I am not to familiar with that just yet. 
I will show some images below of the console output and it cracking a smile 4 character password.
